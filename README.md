# Tic Tac Toe Game
=====================

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project, a Tic Tac Toe game built from scratch using Python. I'm Ajwad Hussain, a passionate developer looking to kick-start my journey in the world of coding. This project is a result of my dedication and hard work, and I'm excited to share it with the community.

## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game of strategy and skill, where two players, X and O, take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

* A 3x3 grid for playing the game
* Two-player mode (X and O)
* Win conditions for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines
* Simple and intuitive gameplay

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I plan to add more features to the game, such as:

* Single-player mode against a computer opponent
* Score tracking and leaderboards
* Improved graphics and user interface
