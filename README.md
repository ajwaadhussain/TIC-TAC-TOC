# TIC-TAC-TOC
Introduction
Welcome to my first project, a Tic Tac Toe game built from scratch using [programming language/technology]. I'm Ajwad Hussain, a passionate developer looking to kick-start my journey in the world of coding. This project is a result of my dedication and hard work, and I'm excited to share it with the community.

Game Description
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game of strategy and skill, where two players, X and O, take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. My implementation of Tic Tac Toe aims to provide a simple yet engaging experience for players of all ages.

Features
A 3x3 grid for playing the game
Two-player mode (X and O)
Win conditions for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines
Simple and intuitive gameplay
